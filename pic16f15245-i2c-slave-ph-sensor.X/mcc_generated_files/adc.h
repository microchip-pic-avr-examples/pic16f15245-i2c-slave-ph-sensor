  @Summary
    This is the generated header file for the ADC driver using PIC10 / PIC12 / PIC16 / PIC18 MCUs

  @Description
    This header file provides APIs for driver for ADC.
    Generation Information :
        Product Revision  :  PIC10 / PIC12 / PIC16 / PIC18 MCUs - 1.81.0
        Device            :  PIC16F15245
        Driver Version    :  2.01
    The generated drivers are tested against the following:
        Compiler          :  XC8 2.20 and above
        MPLAB             :  MPLAB X 5.40

  @Preconditions
    ADC_Initialize() function should have been called before calling this function.

  @Returns
    Returns the converted value.

  @Param
    Pass in required channel number.
    "For available channel refer to enum under adc.h file"
