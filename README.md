# I2C Slave Mode pH Sensing using PIC16F15245

The 'pic16f15245-i2c-slave-ph-sensor' code example highlights the use of the PIC16F15245 micrcontroller to read a pH sensor using the Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC), and transmit the sensor data using the Master Syncronous Serial Port (MSSP) in I2C Slave mode. The example also allows the user to transmit the sensor data through the Enhanced Universal Syncronous Asyncronous Receiver Transmitter (EUSART) module for testing purposes.

5. Connect the Curiosity LPC board to a PC using the Micro-USB to USB 2.0 cable.
6. Program the PIC16F15245 Microcontroller:
   1. If not already on your system, download and install MPLABX IDE version 5.40 (or newer).
   2. If not already on your system, download and install the XC8 C-Compiler version 2.20 (or newer).
   3. Open the 'pic16f15245-i2c-slave-ph-sensor.X' project as shown in Figure 6.

   2. Configure the serial port as shown in Figure 11.

## Operation

The code example is configured such that the pH value is transmitted over the EUSART to the PC terminal program for viewing. Figure 12 shows the default main() loop, with the 'printf' statement actively transmitting the data to the PC.

##### Figure 12: Main() Default Configuration
![Default Main](images/Main1.png)

The pH probe comes with the probe tip stored in a bottle of storage solution. The storage solution has an approximate pH value of 3.8. If the probe is left in the storage solution, the PC terminal program will show a value of 3.8 - 4.0 as shown in Figure 13.

##### Figure 13: Storage Solution pH value
![Default Main](images/StorageSolution.png)

The probe can also be calibrated using the Atlas Scientific calibration fluid as shown in Figure 14. Remove the probe from the storage solution, rinse the tip in distilled water, and place the probe in one of the solutions. If using the pH 4.0 solution, the readings displayed in the terminal program window will show approximately 4.0, while if using the pH 7.0 solution, the readings will show approximately 7.0. It is important to note that whenever the probe is not in use, it MUST be stored in the storage solution. Damage to the probe will result if the sensor is not kept wet at all times.

The code example can be modified to be used as an I2C slave. The snippet provided in Figure 15 shows the code required to convert the 24-bit floating-point temperature value into three unsigned 8-bit values, then load the values into an array that will be read when the I2C bus master requests the information. To use the I2C functions, uncomment the code shown in Figure 15, and comment out the highlighted 'printf' statement shown in Figure 12.

The code example can also be modified such that the values that are expected to be displayed by the I2C Master can be calculated and displayed on your PC. The snippet in Figure 16 shows the inactive code that the I2C Master would use to 'rebuild' the pH data. To use these functions, uncomment the code shown in Figure 16, while leaving the lines of code from Figure 15 uncommented. The PC terminal program will then display the pH data as observed from the Master's perspective.

## Summary

The 'pic16f15245-i2c-slave-ph-sensor' code example highlights the use of the PIC16F15245 micrcontroller to read a pH sensor. The example defaults to transmitting the pH data through the EUSART, but can easily be modified to use as an I2C Slave. The example can also be combined with the code examples listed in the 'Related Documents' section of this readme file to create a commplete I2C Master/Slave bus.
